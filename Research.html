    <h1>User Research</h1>
        
        <h2> Setup </h2>
        <p>
            I was part of a team of 5 that did a user research trial with the Rijksstudio website (part of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam). It was conducted with 5 participants from different backgrounds and ages but with a passion for art. Five research questions were formulated based on our exploration and assumptions on the website. Based on these research questions a list of tasks were made. A test trial was conducted to check the quality of the trial and make adjustments. During the actual trials, I was once a test leader and once an assistant. Participants were asked to perform tasks while they were being recorded as well as their actions on the screen. 
            During the trial I tried to make sure the partcipants were thinking aloud. After the tasks, we interviewed the participants regarding their impressions of the website. After the trial I transcribed the interview. And answered the research question based on the data gathered. </p>

     
        <h2> Data </h2>
        <p>
            The data we've gathered as a group we presented using an action overview, usability problems table, task accuracy table, a Usability Magnitude Estimation (UME) table, Impressions &amp; improvements table and the User liked best and least features table. Here is two examples of the data gathered.</p>

<a href="https://ibb.co/KGBRhXk"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/3sVGd7q/action-overview.png" alt="action-overview" border="0"></a>
    <h2> Results </h2>    
    <p>Based on the data we gathered we concluded that "the functionalities regarding the instructions page, 'make your own route' and licence policy are unclear and not visible enough. The recommendation is to add a help section on the homepage to help users easily achieve their goals. 60% of our users said they would use the website in the future for inspiration and learning purposes. It is also recommended for the Rijksmuseum to state the purpose of the Rijksstudio on the homepage, users have difficulty finding out what the purpose of the website is. 

Furthermore, the Rijksmuseum should rethink their iconography regarding the scissors and the heart icon. 2 out of 5 participants had difficulty understanding what they meant. Overall, the majority of the tasks were more difficult than the user expected, they stated the difficulty level afterwards to be medium - high and impossible."
